<p class="lead">Accredited Family Law Specialist Fidan Shevket and family law solicitor Inoka Ho present our Family Law seminars in various locations on the North Shore of Sydney.</p>

Each seminar runs for approximately one hour and covers a range of issues including; Separation and divorce, parenting matters, child support, property settlement, spouse maintenance, drafting your Agreement and a range of other matters. There is an opportunity to ask questions during the seminar and at the conclusion of the seminar.

During the seminars we do not provide any legal advice however, it is a good opportunity for you to obtain procedural information about the Family Court, the Family Law Act and what you need to be aware of moving forward in your case.

As Family Law solicitors we understand the common difficulties and problems that clients encounter and we will try to address those in the seminar to assist you. We hold both evening seminars and daytime seminars for your convenience.

Call us now to reserve your place on 9440 1202 or email us at lawyers@foxstaniland.com.au to let us know which seminar you'd like to attend and how many people will be attending with you. We look forward to seeing you there!
